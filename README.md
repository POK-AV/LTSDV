# Lower-Thirds-SDV
Stage display viewer in java for propresenter.

The output text is shown in a lower key fashion, i.e. it's shown in the lower part of the screen. It also compactifies rows by removing every second line break, i.e. 4 rows will be shown as 2 rows.

It should work in Windows/MacOS/Linux and other *nix systems

## Known Issues
* Propresenter 5 for Windows does not support UTF-8 correctly which makes international characters to be shown incorrectly, e.g. Swedish characters ÅÄÖ are shown as ???. This is fixed in propresenter 6.

*Logging in as user "Alan Moreno" seems to throw an error
